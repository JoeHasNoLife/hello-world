# hello-world
My first Repository on Github


Hi, my name is Joe & I love coding even though my knowledge is limited.  

Hopefully with a lot of hard work, dedication, practise & feedback I will be on my way to mastering coding in several months but until then wish me luck. 

With this code editor am I able to input here & then it appears in my Github profile/ project!? 

Yes it did, thank god!
